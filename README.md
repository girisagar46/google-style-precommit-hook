A handy [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) hook which will run Google's java
code style formatter for you on your code!

Example Usage:

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/girisagar46/google-style-precommit-hook
  rev: v1.0
  hooks:
  - id: google-style-java
```

See the [releases](https://github.com/girisagar46/google-style-precommit-hook/releases) section about which `rev` to choose.

*Note*: this file stores Google's code style formatter jar in a `.cache/`
directory so that it doesn't need to be re-downloaded each time.  You will
probably want to add `.cache/` to the `.gitignore` file of the project which
uses this hook.
